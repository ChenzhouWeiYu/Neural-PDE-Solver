# Neural PDE Solver

This is the code for the paper

**Learning Neural PDE Solvers with Convergence Guarantees**

Submitted to ICLR 2019.

## Data generation

Modify the script `scripts/generation.sh` and run
```
./scripts/generation.sh
```

*Note*: for now, `image_size` has to be (2^n + 1), e.g. 17, 33, 65, etc.
